# The-Views-of-Leuven-Collection-Dataset
*Full dataset of the Views of Leuven collection which includes images and maps of Leuven from the 16th-20th centuries.* <br><br>
The Views of Leuven collection at [KU Libraries Special Collections](https://bib.kuleuven.be/bijzondere-collecties/english/home) contains 352 images that date from the sixteenth to the twentieth centuries. The images were created using various techniques including lithograph, etching, engraving, porcelain cards, and more. Items in the Views of Leuven collection depict places in Leuven and the surrounding areas, including churches, monasteries, university buildings and other landmarks. The collection also includes panoramic images and maps of Leuven. KU Leuven Libraries digitized this collection in collaboration with [Erfgoedcel Leuven](https://www.erfgoedcelleuven.be/) and other local heritage institutions. The collection can be accessed on the [Erfgoedcel website](https://www.erfgoedplus.be/zoeken?zoekterm=24062A29&categorie=collectie&sort=modifieddate&sort-order=desc) in addition to the KU Leuven Libraries’ [Digital Heritage Online Collection](https://limo.libis.be/primo-explore/collectionDiscovery?vid=KULeuven&collectionId=81411246670001488&lang=en_US). 
 
# The Views of Leuven Dataset
## Repository type
The Views of Leuven dataset is a repository of descriptive metadata representing all of the items in the collection. The dataset also includes links to images of the collection, allowing users to harvest the images to use for visualization. The digitised Views of Leuven Collection can also be explored through the [Libraries’ Digital Heritage Online Collections](https://limo.libis.be/primo-explore/collectionDiscovery?vid=KULeuven&collectionId=81386064490001488&lang=en_US) discovery interface, within the thematic collection [“Views of Leuven”](https://limo.libis.be/primo-explore/collectionDiscovery?vid=KULeuven&collectionId=81411246670001488&lang=en_US).
## Who can use it
The repository is designated as a free resource for digital humanities research, for scholars, students and teachers. It also is intended for creative reuse.
## Examples of Creative Reuse
The Views of Leuen dataset has been used to create an interactive digital map of Leuven through the centuries. The [Mapping Views of Leuven Collection](https://github.com/allisonbearly/Mapping-the-Views-of-Leuven-Collection) repository includes the  basic source files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a modified version of the metadata CSV file found in this repository. The completed project can be seen here. <br><br>
Have you used this dataset in a creative way? [Please share it with us](https://bib.kuleuven.be/english/BD/digit/digitisation/digitisation) so we can add it here and showcase more examples of creative reuse of digital cultural heritage! 
## Provenance
The dataset is based on the library catalogue metadata. It holds the descriptive metadata as well as URL links to the digital viewer and the image thumbnail. The dataset is published in two formats: an XML file that contains the unprocessed dataset as downloaded from the Alma digital preservation environment of KU Leuven Libraries and a cleaned CSV file that contains computationally more amenable curated data. The cleaned CSV file has also been enriched with coordinates for the locations depicted in the image. The data was cleaned, transformed and refined with the [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) application software.
## Technical Aspects
The CSV file contains 352 records in rows and 43 columns. For a correct download click on VoLcomplete.csv. On some web browsers, you need to right-click on 'Raw' and select 'Download linked file as'. For other web browsers, including Chrome, click on 'Raw' and then go to File > Save Page As...  The CSV file can also be downloaded from Zenodo. In order to correctly display the CSV file, the recommended setup for a proper display of the CSV file can be adjusted in the Excel data import popup window: 'Character set' to 'Unicode (UTF-8)', the separator option 'Comma' should be selected and the 'Column type' of Column A (Record ID) should be changed from General to 'Text'.<br><br>
**Notes:**
* An asterisk (&#42;) indicates a category which was added during the data cleaning and transforming process. <br>
* Latitude and Longitude for the places featured in the images were added. However, there are 6 images for which the location could not be determined. Additionally, the map images also do not contain latitude or longitude information. <br>
* Three degree symbols (°°°) are used to separate values in multi-valued cells.</ul> 
The CSV file contains the following metadata:
